# reinforcement-learning
This repository contains implementations of examples from "Reinforment Learning: An Introduction, 2nd Edition" (2018) by Sutton and Barto. It is a continuous work in progress and will develop as progression through the book is made.

## multi-armed_bandits
Contains an implementation of the multi-armed bandit testbed described in Chapter 2 with epsilon-greedy action value methods. The performance with different values of epsilon is evaluated.
